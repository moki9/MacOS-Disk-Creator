## This app is for Installing OS X on Hackintosh PC and Laptop
## I build this installer spatially for difficult configurations.

Based on thefanclub /dd-utility https://github.com/thefanclub/dd-utility and my work for Restore DMG Image

This is a Automator app bundle containing another app created with Platypus 5.1

Containing also Clover EFI Bootloader revision Clover v2.4k r4047 mode ESP (CloverESPOSXImage.pkg)

The OS Installer Packages is create inside the app by the command pkgbuild.

This program will Create a MacOS DMG image.

The Bootloader Clover EFI will be installed in the DMG EFI partition.

PS: (Working for UEFI and Legacy configurations)

The image will be restore with a dd command this will preserve all bootloader Clover file.

Working Inside OS X Mavericks / OS X Yosemite / OS X El Capitan / MacOS Sierra

You can create an OS X image to Mac OS X Lion 10.7 at MacOS Sierra 10.12

( If you have a Mac-OS.dmg disk image on the desktop, it will automatically deleted by the program.
â€‹So If you would like to create more disk images; put the images in a folder apart before starting the program.)

PS : The image can be used in Windows to be restore on a USB stick with a program like Suse Studio. Rename the file .raw or .iso and compress as 7Zip or WinRAR
